# @open-pioneer/check-pnpm-duplicates

Provides the `check-pnpm-duplicates` command line tool.
The tool checks the project's current pnpm lockfile for duplicate packages.
Any unexpected package duplications are reported as an error.

## Installation

```bash
$ pnpm add -D @open-pioneer/check-pnpm-duplicates
```

The tool can be invoked manually (via `pnpm check-pnpm-duplicates -c path/to/config.yaml`) or automatically as part of the `prepare` script:

```jsonc
// package.json
{
    "scripts": {
        "prepare": "check-pnpm-duplicates -c path/to/config.yaml"
    }
}
```

By default, all duplicate packages are reported as errors:

```text
$ pnpm check-pnpm-duplicates
Found unexpected duplicate packages:
  - "@changesets/types" # (versions 4.1.0, 6.0.0)
  - "@pnpm/dependency-path" # (versions 5.1.3, 5.1.6)
  - "@pnpm/resolver-base" # (versions 13.0.1, 13.0.4)
  ...
```

To allow certain duplicates, see below.

## Configuration

The tool can be configured using a YAML file.
This file allows you to specify a list of expected duplicates which are known to not cause any problems.
